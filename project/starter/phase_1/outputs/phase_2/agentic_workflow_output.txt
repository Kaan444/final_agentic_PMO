 Step 1: Worker agent generates a response to the prompt
Prompt:
The development tasks for a product typically involve breaking down each user story into smaller, actionable tasks that need to be completed in order to implement the functionality described in the story. These tasks can include activities such as coding, testing, design, documentation, and deployment.
Worker Agent Response:
Development tasks are defined by identifying what needs to be built to implement each user story. This involves breaking down the user story into smaller, actionable tasks such as coding, testing, design, documentation, and deployment. Each task should contribute towards fulfilling the requirements of the user story and ultimately delivering the desired functionality to the end-users.
 Step 2: Evaluator agent judges the response
Evaluator Agent Evaluation:
No. The response does not provide specific development tasks following the required structure.
 Step 3: Check if evaluation is positive
